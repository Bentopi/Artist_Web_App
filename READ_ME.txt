Wireframe Test Instructions:

Open “index.html” 


—if using Google Chrome, you will have to install the Azure extension, and the instructions to do so will appear on screen.—


I kept the wireframe down to only the requested features, as I didn’t want to clutter the space and make things unnecessarily complicated.




Wireframe includes:

Home / Landing page: 
Here the user can look at image’s titles, size in bytes as well as the image thumbnail; A search bar is available to find a particular image.

User can click on an image to view it in full size and view further details on the image.

Pagination is also available at the bottom of the page, simply click on the right arrow to go to the next page and the left arrow to go to the previous page.

Navigation bar at the top includes a placeholder for the logo (which redirects to the Home Page) as well as the contact page.




Image Detail page:
Here the user can look at the image in full size, as well as a full description of the image, it’s height, width and size in bytes.

The option to go back to the image listings is available in a button at the bottom of the page as well as a “Learn More” button which will redirect to the contact page.
